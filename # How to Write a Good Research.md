Fundamentally, writing a research paper is a process that is unique to different people. Although some argue that research writing is a linear process, it is actually highly recursive, messy, and repetitive. Therefore, anything indicated in this guide should be followed flexibly.
## Title/Topic
It may be silly to have the topic as an important element, but it really is important. The research topic should be as precise as possible and should primarily express the main idea of the paper. 
## Abstract
An abstract is a preview of the paper and is the last thing to be written. 
The abstract should be a little less technical than the article itself and should provide a comprehensive review without using much words
An abstract should be at least 200 words, which summarizes the purpose, methods, results and conclusions of the paper.
I understand that it is not easy to condense everything in a short paragraph. So, you should start by writing a summary that includes whatever you think is important, and then gradually prune it down to size by removing unnecessary words, while still retaining the necessary concepts.
Most importantly, don't use abbreviations or citations in the abstract. 
## Introduction
Present a relevant background knowledge about the topic
I recommend that you summarize the relevant literature so that the reader will understand why you are interested in the topic. 
The most important element of the introduction is the thesis statement. The infographic below perfectly explains how a thesis statement should be written.
 
**Sample thesis statement**: “While some arguments may
be valid, juvenile delinquents should not be transferred to adult courts because the juvenile penal system was particularly designed to rehabilitate rather than to punish.”
## Literature Review

A literature review summarizes current published works that focus on the topic and evaluates anything that has done before. I recommend that the scholarship should not be older than 5 years. As at 2022, most of the sources should be from 2017 upwards.
## Materials & Methods
Here, provide the tools and techniques used to answer the research questions. If a complicated research protocol was used, it may helpful to include a diagram, table or flowchart to explain the methods you used. Seeking IRB approval is also an important part of this section.
Relevant ethical considerations should also be mentioned here. If you used human subjects, did they consent to participate? If you used children, did their parents/guardians assent? If you used animals, what measures did you take to minimize pain?
## Results
Leaving out your personal opinion, detail your results but don't explain. Use graphs and tables if appropriate, but also summarize your main findings in the text. 
Do not discuss the results or speculate as to why something happened; that goes in the discussion section.
Most importantly, use appropriate methods of showing data. Do not try to manipulate the data to make it look like you did more than you actually did.
## Tables and Graphs
Graphs and tables are recommended in order to help the reader visualize and understand your results. If you present your data in a table or graph, include a title describing what's in the table 
If you can summarize the information in one sentence, then a table or graph is not necessary.
## Discussion

In this section, you now get to talk about the results, the effects, and how it all relates to your thesis statement earlier indicated in the introduction.
In this section, highlight the most significant results, but don't just repeat what you've written in the results section. How do these results relate to the thesis statement? Do the data support your hypothesis? Are your results consistent with what other investigators have reported? If your results were unexpected, try to explain why. Is there another way to interpret your results? What further research would be necessary to answer the questions raised by your results? How do y our results fit into the big picture?
## CONCLUSION
Finally, end with a summary of your topic, emphasizing why it is relevant and avenues for future research
## REFERENCES
The reference section is an alphabetized list of academic scholarship. The easiest way to create a bibliography is to jot down the information concerning each original source, every time you use it. Just note the title, author, publication location, publisher, and publication date, and you'll have a complete list by the end of your paper. personally, I use citefast.com to track, organize, and edit my references.

Most importantly, make sure you research, collaborate, and solicit feedback at every stage of research.
Write on!
