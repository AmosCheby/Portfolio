Google AdWords is the most effective Pay Per Click model that enables business owners or enterprise marketers to connect with billions of people who are interested with specific services and products. They help businesses achieve specific goals such as building awareness, driving sales, and tracking specific advertisement metrics. Primarily, Google Ads are built around three main principles: relevance, control and results.

Google Ads certifications are online-based curricula that expound on the use and application of Google Ads in marketing of products and services. Previously, the certifications were offered at Google’s Academy for Ads, but has recently been replaced with Skillshop. The new platform offers online training and certification on Google AdWords such as Display, Search, Measurement, Video and Shopping Ads. It is imperative to indicate that these certifications replaced the “Fundamentals” and “Mobile” exams that were previously offered under the Academy for Ads. In this regard, I decided to pursue Google Ads Search and Display certifications.

 The certification process involves studying and comprehending various courses with several checks and assessments. In spite of the clear and self-explanatory courses, the assessments are very interactive and seek an in-depth understanding of the specific topics and concepts. The assessment process may take an hour and will primarily focus on the competence and mastery of skills in creating and running Google Ads. The pass mark for each certification is currently at 80%. 

Google Ads Display certification teaches strategies to develop effective display campaigns to achieve specific marketing goals. In this regard, it is hypothesized that the ultimate goal of any business is to make sales and grow. As such, advertising starts with creating campaigns based on the business objectives and target market. Largely, the campaigns are based on the determinants of where, when and in what format the ads will be displayed. 

Through this course, you will learn instance device targeting, ad extensions, bidding and budgeting as some of the ways that search campaigns can be optimized. Targeting is optimized through keywords, ad location, age, language, frequency of searches, and devices. The process starts by creation of an ad group with specific texts and a list of keywords and phrases that will prompt ads to show up. In this case, ad extensions provide an opportunity for advertisers to include more information such as links and phone numbers which are relevant to the given ads.

 Through these optimization strategies, advertisers are able to reach the relevant audiences by maximizing the chances of clicks and subsequent conversions. Bidding is a system strategy manner in which you pay for users to interact with your ads. There are numerous bid strategies that influence how a campaign performs and how visible the ads are. To optimize the bidding process, Google Ads has an automated feature that uses machine learning (ML) to algorithmically help set the bids for every auction thus improving the efficiency and performance of ads. 

These certifications will help business owners and all tech enthusiasts in general to take advantage of the benefits of online advertising. Every day about 5.5 billion searches are made using Google search. Incidentally, in addition to providing sufficient knowledge on how to control marketing costs, this certification educates on necessary skills to manage campaigns through collection of valuable data and using specific analytical tools to measure the success. 


In summary, the Google Ads certifications on Search and Display is a great place to start your online advertising journey!
